# React Redux Webpack Starter Template
By default *Hash history* is active if you want to use *Catch all* metod, just change *HashRouter* with *BrowserRouter* in the *"src/index.js"*.
More about this problem and possible solutions you can read [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27928372/react-router-urls-dont-work-when-refreshing-or-writting-manually).

Redux example you can find on the *Fruit* page. <br />
You can access "*process.env.NODE_ENV*" from the React. <br />
I use this example as starter template in my React projects.
